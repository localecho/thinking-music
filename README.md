# Thinking Music

A generative ambient visualization of harmonic consciousness.

## About

Thinking Music is an Eno-inspired generative system where jazz harmony becomes a living, breathing environment. Chords emerge, drift, and dissolve in space. The system modulates through keys and modes using circle-of-fifths weighting, creating infinite harmonic variation.

**Pure sine waves.** Spatial panning. Long envelopes. Reverb tails that blur into silence.

## Interaction

- **Click** anywhere to seed thoughts and update the center
- **Space** to force a new center chord
- **D/I/L/M/A/P** keys switch modes (dorian, ionian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, phrygian)
- **C/D/E/F/G/A/B** keys change the tonal center

## Technical

- Web Audio API for synthesis
- No dependencies
- Single HTML file
- Generative system with weighted randomness
- Modal harmony with circle-of-fifths drift
- Spatial audio positioning based on visual location

## Design Philosophy

No UI chrome. No instructions. No explanations.

The environment IS the interface.
